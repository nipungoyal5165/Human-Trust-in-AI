# Human-Trust-in-AI
The objective of this project was to determine whether humans continued to have confidence in AI systems' ability to accurately predict diseases and participate in contemporary healthcare. The research was extensive, with a large number of surveys conducted and 576 articles considered merely to gain a more profound understanding of the subject matter and to train the AI model accordingly. Individuals had concerns regarding privacy, capability, safety, and numerous other factors. My primary objective was to determine whether the advantages of AI outweighed its disadvantages, which proved to be accurate. Initially, the AI was trained on historical data from 2000 to 2020 and subsequently evaluated to make predictions for the decade 2020 to 2030. I employed a linear regression model to ensure that the results were easily comprehensible and to indicate whether the objective was achieved. Additionally, I verified the results by utilizing evaluation metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) and the R-squared score. In conclusion, my research contributed to the enhancement of public confidence in artificial intelligence.
